***************************************
Overview
***************************************
XIPHost is a Java based standalone application, used to query and retrieve DICOM data and non-DICOM objects 
(e.g. XML annotation objects) from a local file system, caGrid, DICOM repositories and AVT Assessment Database. 
It manages and invokes image processing applications conforming to DICOM WG-23 standard. 
It allows to submit data to those applications for processing, supports data storage in a local files system, 
caGrid enabled repositories, DICOM repositories and AVT Assessment Database.

XIP Host Reference Implementation is compliant with "File Access" and "Native Model" 
of WG23 interface as defined in Supplement 118 v. 25.

User Instructions
***************************************

1. When launching XIP Host for the first time, end user is prompted to specify
   parent of TmpXIP and OutXIP directories plus directory to store DICOM objects
   managed by Pixelmed server and HSQLDB. This does not apply if dirs exist on a system where host is running.

   TmpXIP directory is used to store data retrieved from caGid before passing it to
   the XIP application. TmpXIP directory content is cleared at the Host exit time. 
   CAUTION: any content placed under TmpXIP directory will be permanently deleted
   after Host termination.

   OutXIP is XIP Application's output directory. It is used to store data produced
   by XIP Application. OutXIP directory content is preserved between XIP Host
   subsequent launches.

   Optional ways of setting TmpXIP and OutXIP include:
       - modifying xipConfig.xml file found in ..\xip-reference-impl\XIP\config\
   
   To configure AVT Assessment Database connection modify the following file:
   ..\xip-reference-impl\config\DB2_ADConfig.xml

2. Data must be selected prior to any application launch. End user can select
   data from the local file system, query/retrieve data from the DICOM repository,
   caGrid or AVT AD repository.

3. XIP Host supports multi application management. More than one application can be
   ran at the same time. To switch between running application use tabs located on
   the right site of the host. 
   XIP Host allows also to run more than one instance of the same application at
   the same time. 

4. Worklist
   XIP Host Reference Implementation comes with a simple worklist functionality.
   The definition of each worklist entry can be found in:

         ..\xip-referenceimpl\XIP\config\worklist.xml
   
   Application assigned to worklist entry should be first added/registered with
   the host before executing worklist entry.

   To execute worklist item, click twice on a worklist entry. 
   Steps that follow:
        - DICOM and AIM data is retrieved from caGrid repository 
          and stored in TmpXIP directory
        - application is automatically launched, and dataset used for display or to be processed.

   Note: depending on the quality of the network connection and the volume of the
   data being retrieved, time to download data may take few minutes. 

5. To add XIP Application
      - 'Options / Add application' or
      - modify ..\xip-referenceimpl\XIP\config\applications.xml
      Note: Name and Path attributes are required. Path should point to the application
      executable file (.bat, .exe, .sh).

6. To terminate XIP application
      - select application's tab
      - select 'Exit' from the tool bar

7. To add/modify/remove grid and pacs location
      - modify grid_locations.xml or pacs_locations.xml accordingly
      Note: host verifies location parameters. If location does not pass validation test 
      it is not loaded at host startup.
